description: I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Computer Engineering in 2021. After completing my undergraduate studies, I decided to continue my education and pursue a Ph.D. in the field of Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). I am currently working under the guidance of Professor Chang D. Yoo, whose expertise and leadership have been invaluable to my research. My research focuses on the reliability of Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning technologies for various modalities, including images, videos, and natural language. I am passionate about exploring the potential of these technologies and finding ways to improve their performance and reliability in real-world applications. In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field of AI/DL, as well as reading and learning about other areas of computer science and engineering. I am excited to continue my studies at KAIST and to see where my research takes me in the future!
